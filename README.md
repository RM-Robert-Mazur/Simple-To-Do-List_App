# 📝 Simple To Do List 📝

This is very simple to-do list app build with JavaScript. This project was a part of my aim to refresh my basic JavaScript knowledge. This app uses local storage to store added entries/tasks to the list.

Another useful functionality of this to-do app is the ability to search for desired tasks from the list. We can also remove any unwanted or completed tasks.

I have also built another and surely more advanced to-do list app which you can find in my different repository.
